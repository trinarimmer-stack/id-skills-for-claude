# Instructional Design Skill: Quality Assurance 
Testing for E-Learning

## Overview
Quality assurance (QA) testing is the systematic process 
of verifying that an e-learning course works correctly, 
teaches effectively, and is ready for learner-facing 
deployment. It is the final — and frequently rushed — 
phase of e-learning development, and it's where 
otherwise well-designed courses fail publicly. 
This skill helps Claude support instructional designers 
in planning, executing, and documenting QA processes 
that catch functional, instructional, editorial, 
and accessibility issues before launch.

## Core Principle: QA Is a Design Responsibility, 
Not a Production Afterthought
QA is not proofreading. It is a structured evaluation 
of whether the course does what it was designed to do — 
functionally, instructionally, and experientially. 
Treating it as a last-minute checkbox produces 
last-minute surprises.

Effective QA:
- Is planned at project kickoff, not tacked on at the end
- Has dedicated time in the project timeline
- Is conducted by someone other than the developer 
  where possible
- Covers function, instruction, content, and experience
- Is documented so issues can be tracked and resolved

## The Four Layers of E-Learning QA

### Layer 1: Functional QA
Does everything work as built?

### Layer 2: Instructional QA
Does it teach what it's supposed to teach?

### Layer 3: Editorial QA
Is the content accurate, consistent, and well-written?

### Layer 4: Accessibility QA
Can every learner access and use the course?

All four layers must be tested. Most teams only 
test Layer 1 — and wonder why courses underperform.

- [ ] Characters and contexts are believable

### Learning Experience
- [ ] Course opens with clear relevance — 
      why this matters to this learner
- [ ] Pacing feels appropriate — 
      not rushed, not padded
- [ ] Learner is never confused about 
      what to do next
- [ ] Course closes with application, 
      not just summary

## AI-Assisted QA

AI can significantly accelerate certain QA tasks — 
particularly editorial and instructional review.

### Where AI Helps Most

**Consistency checking**
Paste course content and ask AI to flag:
- Inconsistent terminology
- Mixed tone or voice
- Capitalization and formatting inconsistencies
- Hollow affirmations and filler phrases

**Reading level analysis**
Ask AI to evaluate readability and 
flag sentences above the target reading level.

**Alignment check**
Provide learning objectives and course content 
and ask AI to identify any content that 
doesn't connect to an objective — 
or any objective not addressed by content.

**Assessment review**
Paste assessment items and ask AI to evaluate:
- Whether questions test application 
  or just recall
- Whether distractors are plausible
- Whether feedback explains the why
- Whether any questions are ambiguous 
  or potentially trick-based

**Alt text review**
Paste alt text descriptions and ask AI 
to evaluate whether they convey meaningful 
information or are generic and unhelpful.

**Script review**
Paste narration scripts and ask AI to flag:
- Sentences that would sound unnatural 
  when spoken aloud
- Passive voice
- Overly long or complex sentences
- Tone inconsistencies

### AI QA Prompt Examples
Review the following e-learning content for 
editorial consistency. Flag:
Any inconsistent use of terminology
Passive voice
Hollow affirmations (Great job!, Correct!, etc.)
Filler phrases (In this module we will...)
Reading level issues (target: Grade 8)
Tone shifts between formal and casual

Do not rewrite — flag specific instances 
with line references and brief explanations.

[Paste content]
```

```
I have the following learning objectives 
and course content outline.

Evaluate alignment:
1. Which content sections connect to 
   which objectives?
2. Are there any objectives not addressed 
   by the content?
3. Are there any content sections that 
   don't connect to any objective?
4. Are the objectives written as observable, 
   measurable performance behaviors?

[Paste objectives and outline]

### AI QA Limitations
- Cannot test functional behavior — 
  buttons, branching, LMS communication
- Cannot evaluate whether scenarios 
  feel realistic to the target audience
- Cannot replace screen reader or 
  keyboard navigation testing
- May miss cultural sensitivity issues 
  in specialized contexts
- Cannot verify factual accuracy 
  in specialized domains

---

## QA Process and Documentation

### Build QA Into the Project Timeline
QA is consistently under-resourced because 
it's added at the end rather than planned 
from the start.

Recommended allocation:
- Simple course (linear, low interaction): 
  10–15% of development time
- Moderate course (scenarios, branching): 
  15–20% of development time
- Complex course (simulations, heavy branching): 
  20–25% of development time

### QA Roles
**Self-review**
The developer reviews their own work. 
Catches obvious errors but misses many issues — 
familiarity blinds us to our own mistakes.

**Peer review**
A colleague reviews the course fresh. 
More effective than self-review for 
catching errors the developer is blind to.

**SME review**
Subject matter expert reviews for 
content accuracy. Should be scoped 
specifically: *"Please review for 
technical accuracy only."*

**Stakeholder review**
Client or sponsor reviews for 
organizational fit and final approval. 
Should not be a content review — 
that happened earlier.

**Learner pilot**
A small group from the target audience 
completes the course. The most valuable 
QA activity — catches issues no 
internal reviewer will find.

### Bug Tracking
Document every issue found during QA:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **ID** | Unique identifier for the issue |
| **Location** | Module, lesson, slide/screen number |
| **Description** | Clear description of the issue |
| **Layer** | Functional / Instructional / Editorial / Accessibility |
| **Severity** | Critical / Major / Minor |
| **Status** | Open / In Progress / Fixed / Verified / Closed |
| **Assigned to** | Who is responsible for fixing |
| **Notes** | Additional context or screenshots |

### Severity Definitions

**Critical**
Prevents course completion or produces 
incorrect learning outcomes.
- Broken navigation that traps learners
- Incorrect scoring that fails passing learners
- Assessment that marks wrong answers correct
- Missing required content

**Major**
Significantly degrades the experience 
but doesn't prevent completion.
- Broken media (audio, video, images)
- Incorrect feedback on assessment items
- Significant accessibility barriers
- Major content inaccuracies

**Minor**
Small issues that don't significantly 
impact learning or completion.
- Typos and grammatical errors
- Minor formatting inconsistencies
- Small visual glitches
- Non-critical placeholder text

### Sign-Off Process
Define who must approve the course 
before launch — and what "approved" means.

Recommended sign-off chain:
1. Developer self-review complete
2. Peer/QA reviewer sign-off
3. SME content accuracy sign-off
4. Accessibility review sign-off
5. LMS/technical sign-off
6. Stakeholder/sponsor final approval

Document all sign-offs in writing. 
Verbal approvals create disputes.

---

## Post-Launch QA

QA doesn't end at launch. Build in a 
post-launch review cycle:

**Week 1–2:**
- Monitor LMS for completion and scoring anomalies
- Collect and review learner feedback
- Address any critical issues immediately

**Month 1:**
- Review assessment data for patterns 
  (questions with unusually high failure rates 
  may indicate design issues, not learner issues)
- Gather manager feedback on whether 
  learners are applying skills on the job
- Document any issues for next revision cycle

**Annual or triggered review:**
- Review content for accuracy and currency
- Update examples, statistics, and references
- Reassess alignment to current job requirements

---

## Common QA Mistakes

- **No QA plan** — testing happens ad hoc 
  and inconsistently
- **Developer-only review** — familiarity 
  blinds developers to their own errors
- **Testing only in preview mode** — 
  LMS behavior can differ significantly 
  from authoring tool preview
- **Skipping cross-browser testing** — 
  courses that work in Chrome may 
  break in Safari or Edge
- **No learner pilot** — the target audience 
  always finds issues internal reviewers miss
- **Undocumented bug tracking** — 
  issues get lost, fixed things get 
  re-broken, status is unclear
- **Verbal sign-offs** — no paper trail 
  when disputes arise
- **Treating QA as optional under time pressure** — 
  the time saved skipping QA is always 
  paid back in post-launch fixes and 
  damaged credibility
- **No post-launch monitoring** — 
  assuming launch = done
